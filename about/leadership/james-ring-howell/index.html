      <p>James is the founder and chief software architect for CoralFire. He has been exploring the world of information technology for over 30 years passionately helping people and businesses use computers to better their lives. In addition to working on projects dealing with network creation and operations, email, databases, ERP systems, and web technologies of all kinds, he has also taught on all of these topics over the last 20 years. James enjoys sharing his knowledge and experience as much as he enjoys acquiring more.</p>

<p>CoralFire has afforded James the benefit of working in, and learning about wide variety of industries including automotive, insurance, medical, accounting, real estate, defense, entertainment, and event production. He was also one of the earliest entrants into the web consulting field starting with HTML and Perl programming in 1993.</p>

<p>James studied both Software Engineering and Opera Singing in college which lead to him meeting his wife when they were both singing in Siena, Italy. He now spends some of his free time singing with not only his wife, but 2 daughters who also, to his great happiness, love music.</p>
