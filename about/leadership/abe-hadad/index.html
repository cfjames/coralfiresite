      <h1 class="content-title">Abe Hadad</h1>

      

      <p>Abe is vice president and development lead at CoralFire. He has an eclectic background in industrial controls, manufacturing, project management, system administration, and financial markets. The common thread in these experiences is his passion for information technology and  creative problem-solving. Abe thrives on bringing order to chaos, and developing simple, intuitive solutions to complex problems. He joined CoralFire because he found them to be of the same featherâ€”an organization in which expertise and integrity thrive.</p>

<p>Abe draws creative inspiration from his personal life, where he can be found constructing DIY &ldquo;green&rdquo; projects, cooking international cuisine, and telling impromptu bedtime stories to his four girls. Abe and his wife are passionate about mentoring and counseling couples to have more rewarding relationships.</p>
