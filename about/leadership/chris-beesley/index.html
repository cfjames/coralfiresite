      <p>Chris leads design and branding projects at CoralFire. He brings a diverse set of experiences to each project including branding, print, and user experience design for clients ranging from small start-ups to fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p>Chris&rsquo; trajectory towards design began early in life when he became insistent about selecting the perfect typeface for his name on these cool new things called computers in his elementary school. Since those fateful beginnings he explored many creative outlets before pursuing design while studying at the School of Visual Arts in New York City.</p>

<p>During his free time he can be found thinking about typography, doodling on scraps of paper, and filling his phone with way too many pictures of his daughter.</p>
